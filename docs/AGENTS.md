# Recent Agent Session Updates (Dec 27–28, 2025)

This section records the work completed in the prior Copilot chat so a new agent session can pick up with full context.

## Staff dashboard access + permissions

- Added a staff “Orders” experience end-to-end:
  - New staff orders page: [client/pages/StaffOrders.tsx](client/pages/StaffOrders.tsx)
  - Route added: `/staff/orders` guarded by `RequireStaff` in [client/App.tsx](client/App.tsx)
  - Uses existing staff APIs:
    - `GET /api/staff/me` for auth + profile
    - `GET /api/staff/orders` (requires `view_orders`)
    - `PATCH /api/staff/orders/:orderId/status` (requires `edit_orders`)

- Improved staff landing UX: staff go to `/staff/dashboard` and choose actions based on permissions:
  - Dashboard now shows “What you can do” with an Orders button enabled/disabled by `permissions.view_orders`: [client/pages/StaffDashboard.tsx](client/pages/StaffDashboard.tsx)

- Fixed staff access edge-case: when the parent client is payment-locked, staff routes now redirect to `/account-locked` (instead of looping back to staff login): `RequireStaff` in [client/App.tsx](client/App.tsx)

- Fixed a data mismatch: backend returns `storeName` for staff profile; UI was reading `store_name`. Dashboard now supports both fields: [client/pages/StaffDashboard.tsx](client/pages/StaffDashboard.tsx)

## Staff auth/logout + server correctness

- Added staff logout endpoint that clears the HttpOnly staff cookie:
  - New endpoint `POST /api/staff/logout` registered in [server/index.ts](server/index.ts)
  - Handler `staffLogout` implemented in [server/routes/staff.ts](server/routes/staff.ts)
  - Staff UI now calls `/api/staff/logout` on logout

- Fixed staff order status update handler to accept the route param `:orderId` (body `orderId` optional): `updateStaffOrderStatus` in [server/routes/staff.ts](server/routes/staff.ts)

## Tests/verification added

- Added unit tests for staff middleware auth + permission checks:
  - [server/utils/__tests__/staff-middleware.test.ts](server/utils/__tests__/staff-middleware.test.ts)
- Verified this session’s changes with `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` (all passing).

## Admin Profile page cleanup

- Removed Security, Support, and Integrations sections from the Profile page:
  - Deleted the password change UI block, support buttons, and local “integrations” settings UI
  - Cleaned related state/handlers/imports
  - File updated: [client/pages/admin/Profile.tsx](client/pages/admin/Profile.tsx)

# 🎨 **HOW TO MAKE ECOPRO LOOK CUSTOM-CODED (Not AI-Generated)**

**Goal:** Build the platform 100% using AI while ensuring the final product looks like a handcrafted masterpiece by a human engineer. Break the "Antigravity/AI-generated" look by following these rules:

## 1. Break the "Generic UI" Pattern

AI defaults to standard layouts and boring color palettes. **Force uniqueness:**

- **Unique Micro-Interactions:** Don't ask for "a tracking bar." Ask for specific custom animations—like a truck icon with subtle vibration, or a loading state that reflects Algerian brand identity.
- **Irregular Layouts:** AI loves symmetry. Force asymmetrical grids or unique spacing that doesn't follow standard templates.
- **Custom Illustrations/Icons:** Avoid FontAwesome defaults. Generate unique SVGs or custom icons for bespoke feel.

## 2. Force Human-Like Coding Standards

AI code is often "too perfect" or repetitive. **Add human imperfections:**

- **Domain-Specific Naming:** Instead of `OrderFactoryBuilder`, use `EcoreShipmentDispatcher` or `Sahla4ecoOrderRouter`. Names should reflect the actual business domain.
- **Opinionated Architecture:** Dictate specific patterns (like Domain-Driven Design) that AI wouldn't usually pick.
- **Contextual Comments:** Write comments explaining **why** a decision was made, not just what the code does:
  ```typescript
  // Fix for Algerian SMS gateway latency - do not refactor
  const SMS_RETRY_DELAY = 3000; // Yalidine requires 3s between requests
  ```
- **Intentional Imperfections:** Use values like `padding: 13px` instead of `12px` to break the "perfect" AI grid.

## 3. Implement "Slow Thinking" Features

AI-built sites lack deep business logic. **Add complex edge cases:**

- **Algerian-Specific Logic:** Handle all 05/06/07 mobile prefixes, Wilaya-based delivery costs, local payment flows.
- **Deep Integrations:** Build multi-step workflows like "Meta Instant Form → AI Bot → WhatsApp Confirmation" instead of simple buttons.
- **Error Handling for Local Reality:** Handle slow mobile data, intermittent connections, Algerian SMS gateway quirks.

## 4. Use the "Surgery" Workflow

**Never ask AI to "build the whole page."** That produces generic results.

- **One Intent Per Session:** Each chat session = one specific feature or fix.
- **Review Checklist:** Before finishing, ask: "Does this have proper error handling? Are there hardcoded values? Is mobile view actually usable?"
- **Manual Polish:** Spend 10% of time manually adjusting small things:
  - Change button wording to natural Darija/slang
  - Adjust CSS values by 1px to break perfect grids
  - Add location-specific references ("Livraison rapide à Alger")

## 5. Naming Conventions (Domain-Specific)

Use names that reflect the actual platform purpose, not generic patterns:

| Generic (AI Default) | Custom (Human Style) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `UserController` | `Sahla4ecoStoreOwnerController` |
| `OrderService` | `DZOrderFulfillmentService` |
| `ProductRepository` | `CatalogManager` |
| `PaymentGateway` | `CODValidator` |
| `NotificationSystem` | `BotOrchestrator` |

## 6. Code Style Guidelines

- **Max 26 Behavioral Dimensions:** Research shows AI loses fidelity after 26 distinct rules. Keep instructions focused on top 5-10 critical behaviors.
- **Context Window Management:** Use sliding windows or summarization. Don't pass 100-message history for every turn.
- **Prompt Compression:** Cache static system prompt parts to reduce costs by 50%.

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

1. **NEVER create a local database** - Only use the Render PostgreSQL database
2. **NEVER ask the user to do anything** - You are the one who does everything
3. **Database URL** is in `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`
4. **Always read this file completely** before making any changes

**Read PLATFORM_OVERVIEW.md first before coding.**

When you start coding or a new chat session begins, ask yourself these questions:

## Understanding the Problem

1. **What feature are we building/fixing?** Be specific.
2. **Who does it affect?** (store owner, customer, both?)
3. **What's the current behavior vs desired behavior?**
4. **Is this on the frontend, backend, or database?**
5. **Does this affect orders, products, or stores?**

## Database Questions

1. **Which table(s) are involved?** (store_orders, client_store_products, client_store_settings, etc)
2. **Do we need to add/modify columns?**
3. **What client_id should records have?**
4. **Are we filtering by the right WHERE clause?**
5. **Do we need new indexes for performance?**

## Authentication & Authorization

1. **Who needs to be authenticated?** (store owner, customer, admin, public?)
2. **Is this a public endpoint or protected?**
3. **How do we verify the user's permission?** (their client_id, role, etc)
4. **Should the response expose sensitive data?**

## API Endpoints

1. **Does this need a new endpoint or modify existing?**
2. **Is it GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE?**
3. **What parameters does it need?**
4. **What does it return?**
5. **Should it be in `/api/client/*`, `/api/seller/*`, or `/api/storefront/*`?**

## Frontend Questions

1. **What page/component needs this?** (Orders.tsx, ProductDetail.tsx, Checkout.tsx, etc)
2. **Do we need new state? (useState, useQuery, useEffect)**
3. **Are we calling the right API endpoint?**
4. **Do we handle loading, error, and empty states?**
5. **Should we store anything in localStorage?** (try not to - use database instead)

## Data Flow Questions

1. **How does data flow from user action → API → database → back to UI?**
2. **Where do we validate data?** (frontend for UX, backend for security)
3. **What happens if the API fails?** (show error to user, retry, etc)
4. **Is this a public action (anyone can do it) or authenticated (owner only)?**

## Before Deploying

1. **Does TypeScript compile?** (`pnpm typecheck`)
2. **Do tests pass?** (`pnpm test`)
3. **Is the database change safe?** (backup before migrations)
4. **Does the feature work end-to-end?** (test full flow locally)
5. **Did we break anything else?** (test related features)

# Platform Specifics - Answer These Once

These answers define how the platform works. Read them before building anything.

## Store & Ownership

1. **Store Owners vs Customers**
   - **Storefront** = a unique store page with products (like mystore.ecopro.com/store/store-slug)
   - **Store owner** signs up → automatically gets ONE storefront with a unique store_slug
   - **Customers** find stores via links shared by store owners on social media (Instagram, WhatsApp, etc)
   - Customers are completely anonymous - no accounts, no tracking
   - Store owners are regular users (user_type = "client" or "seller")
   - **Admin** is separate - admin@ecopro.com - sees platform statistics only, has NO store

2. **Multi-Store per Owner**
   - One store owner = ONE storefront (one store_slug)
   - Not multi-store for now

3. **Product Management**
   - Only store owners can upload products to their store
   - Customers can only browse and order

## Ordering & Payments

4. **Payment Handling - Customer Orders**
   - NO online customer payments yet (phase 2)
   - Customers pay CASH ON DELIVERY (COD) - pay when they receive the product
   - Order flow: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered
   - Store owner manually marks orders as they fulfill them

5. **Store Owner Billing** ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE (Phase 2 & 3 pending)
   - Store owners will pay monthly subscription to use the platform
   - **Subscription Model**:
     - **Free Trial**: Every new store gets 30 days free ✅ IMPLEMENTED
     - After 30 days: Account locks until payment is made 🟡 PHASE 2
     - **Paid Tier**: $7/month, no limitations, unlimited everything ✅ CONFIGURED
   - **Payment processor: RedotPay** 🟡 PHASE 3 (pending integration)
   - **Admin Dashboard Metrics** ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - ALL implemented:
     - Total Revenue (MRR - Monthly Recurring Revenue) ✅
     - Active Subscriptions count ✅
     - Unpaid/Expired Subscriptions count ✅
     - Churn Rate (cancelled subscriptions) ✅
     - New Signups This Month ✅
     - List of All Stores with subscription status ✅ (Stores endpoint)
     - Payment Failures (retry needed) ✅
   - **Account Lock Mechanism**:
     - After 30-day free trial expires → 🟡 PHASE 2 (middleware needed)
     - Store owner cannot access their store → 🟡 PHASE 2 (enforcement)
     - Message shows: "Subscription expired. Pay $7/month to unlock" 🟡 PHASE 2 (UI)
     - Link to RedotPay checkout 🟡 PHASE 3 (integration)
   - **PHASE 1 STATUS**: Database, API, Admin Dashboard ✅ COMPLETE
   - **PHASE 2 TODO**: Account lock enforcement, signup validation, UI
   - **PHASE 3 TODO**: RedotPay integration, auto-renewal, payment processing
   - **Reference**: See PHASE1_BILLING_COMPLETE.md and BILLING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md

6. **Inventory** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Track stock per product (`stock_quantity` in client_store_products table)
   - Store owner sets quantity when uploading product
   - Each order decreases stock automatically
   - When stock hits 0 → product is "out of stock"
   - Customers can't order out-of-stock products (error on checkout)
   - ProductDetail page shows: "✓ In Stock (N available)" or "✗ Out of Stock"
   - Out-of-stock products show disabled "Buy Now" button

6. **Customer Accounts**
   - Customers are fully anonymous - no accounts, no tracking
   - Guest checkout only - order info collected: name, email, phone, address
   - WhatsApp notification gives order updates (no account needed)
   - Future: Can add customer tracking links via WhatsApp if needed

## Order & Store Management

7. **Order Fulfillment**
   - Orders marked as "pending" by default (waiting for customer confirmation via bot)
   - Bot sends WhatsApp/SMS with confirmation link → customer approves/declines
   - Order status AUTOMATICALLY becomes confirmed/declined based on customer action
   - Store owner then manually changes status from confirmed → shipped → delivered

8. **Stores Visibility - Multi-Vendor Platform**
   - Each store owner is completely isolated - only sees their own store's data
   - Store owner sees ONLY their own orders, products, customers
   - Store owner cannot see other stores' data
   - Admin sees ALL orders, ALL stores, ALL store owners (platform overview)
   - Customers never see other customers' orders
   - Orders page has tabs to filter by: All, Pending (awaiting confirmation), Confirmed, Archived

9. **Public vs Private**
   - All storefronts are PUBLIC by default
   - Anyone with the store link can order
   - Private stores = future feature

## Communication & Status

10. **Notifications - Automated Bot System** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Platform has a BOT that sends WhatsApp + SMS messages to customers
    - Store owner configures delays in bot settings (e.g., WhatsApp after 1 hour, SMS after 4 hours)
    - Store owner provides WhatsApp credentials (Twilio WhatsApp API)
    - Store owner can CUSTOMIZE message templates (with variables: {customerName}, {storeName}, {productName}, {price}, etc)
    - Bot is optional - store owner enables/disables it
    - Messages contain confirmation links: `https://storename-ecopro.com/store/store-slug/order/ABC123/confirm`
    - Message includes: customer name, store name, product name, price, and confirmation link
    - Confirmation page shows: all product info + buttons (Approve, Decline, Change Details)
    - Customer can EDIT ANY order details from "Change Details" before approving
    - Confirmation link expires after 48 hours
    - After customer responds to both messages (WhatsApp + SMS) → order status auto-updates to confirmed/declined
    - If customer declines → order moves to "archived/cancelled" after 24 hours in Orders page
    - If customer doesn't respond within 24 hours → order moves to "pending orders" place (awaiting response)
    - Store owner sees orders in dashboard in real-time (Orders page)
    - SMS integration: Structure ready, server under development
    
    **Implementation Files:**
    - `server/utils/bot-messaging.ts` - Twilio integration, message scheduling, template variables
    - `server/routes/order-confirmation.ts` - Confirmation page endpoints
    - `client/pages/storefront/OrderConfirmation.tsx` - Confirmation UI (Approve/Decline/Change)
    - `server/migrations/20251219_bot_message_tracking.sql` - Database tables for messages and confirmations
    - Background jobs:
      - Bot message sender runs every 5 minutes
      - Order cleanup runs every 1 hour (archives declined orders, cleans up expired links)

11. **Product Templates**
    - Templates (jewelry, electronics, etc) are just UI/styling
    - No different workflows - all products work the same way
    - Add new template = new component file

# Gold Template Editor (V2) — Client-Only Template Editing (NOT Building)

**Owner decision recap (December 27, 2025)**

## Goal
Provide a **new advanced editor** for **Gold tier clients** that can edit pre-built template pages “in every corner” (within the schema), while keeping the **existing/old editor** for **Silver tier**.

## Key Rules (Hard Requirements)
1. **This editor edits templates; it does NOT build templates.**
  - **Admins build/create templates and their pages** ahead of time.
  - **Clients only edit** those admin-provided template pages.
  - Clients cannot create new templates or new template page structures outside the schema.

2. **Tier gating by subscription/account type**
  - **Silver**: keeps the old editor.
  - **Gold**: gets the new editor.
  - The editor and available templates must be enforced server-side (not only UI).

3. **Silver vs Gold templates are different**
  - Each tier has its **own set of templates and pages**.
  - Each tier may have a **different schema/structure**, so the editor must be schema-aware per tier.

4. **Layout-first, product placeholders (no binding to live products yet)**
  - Template pages are **layout-only** initially.
  - Use **placeholder blocks/slots** for product areas to avoid “endless product management” inside the editor.
  - Later, placeholders can be mapped to real data (e.g., client products), but the V2 editor should treat them as layout components.

## Data Model & Persistence (Recommended Pattern)
To keep admin templates immutable and client changes isolated:
- **Base template pages**: stored as admin-managed JSON documents (read-only for clients).
- **Client overrides**: stored per `client_id` as either:
  - a full overridden page JSON, or
  - a patch/diff against the base JSON.

Must support:
- versioning (`version` in the document)
- migrations (upgrade stored docs when schema changes)
- optimistic locking (ETag/If-Match) to prevent lost updates

## Authorization & Tenant Isolation
- Clients can only read/edit their own saved overrides (`client_id` scoped).
- Admins can manage base templates and base pages.
- Gold-only endpoints must enforce plan checks (Silver cannot access Gold editor APIs).

## Scope Boundaries (What NOT to Build Yet)
- Do not implement an “admin template builder” inside the editor V2.
- Do not implement “full live product binding” inside the editor.
- Avoid creating new schemas that break existing storefront rendering without a migration plan.

## Open Design Notes (Allowed to Decide Later)
- Where to store base templates/pages and client overrides (dedicated tables vs existing settings JSON).
- Whether overrides are stored as full documents vs patches.
- How many pages per template (home/product/category/checkout/etc.) and how routing maps to page IDs.

# 🚨 TEMPLATE BUILDING REFERENCE - READ BEFORE CREATING NEW TEMPLATES

**MANDATORY: Before building ANY new template, read `/docs/TEMPLATE_EDITS_REFERENCE.md`**

This file contains:
- Complete list of all editable features and their setting keys
- ThemeColors interface with 40+ properties to implement
- Database whitelist of allowed columns (server/routes/client-store.ts)
- Edit panel binding functions (bindText, bindColor, bindSelect, bindRange, etc.)
- Step-by-step guide for adding new editable fields
- CSS variables system for custom styling

## Quick Checklist for New Templates

1. **Read** `/docs/TEMPLATE_EDITS_REFERENCE.md` completely
2. **Implement** the full `ThemeColors` interface for consistency
3. **Use** the same setting keys (template_*) so edits persist correctly
4. **Add** `data-edit-path` attributes to all clickable/editable elements
5. **Register** any new settings in server whitelist (client-store.ts allowedCols)
6. **Test** all edit paths work in GoldTemplateEditor

## Required Template Files
```
client/pages/storefront/templates/gold/{template-name}/
├── {TemplateName}Template.tsx    # Main component with ThemeColors
├── schema-types.ts               # TypeScript types
└── {template-name}-home.json     # Default layout (optional)
```

## Core Edit Features Every Template Must Support
- Logo upload & store name
- Header/footer colors
- Hero section (title, subtitle, kicker, buttons, image/video)
- Product grid with configurable columns
- Category pills styling
- Typography (font family, weights)
- Border radius controls
- Spacing controls
- Animation controls
- Custom CSS injection
- Social links
- Navigation menu

---

12. **Order Statuses**
    - pending (default when order created, waiting for customer confirmation via bot)
    - confirmed (customer approved via bot confirmation link)
    - declined (customer declined via bot confirmation link)
    - shipped (store owner marks it)
    - delivered (store owner marks it)
    - cancelled (customer or store owner can do this)

13. **Customer Info Collected**
    - name (required)
    - email (optional)
    - phone (required for WhatsApp/SMS)
    - shipping_address (optional)

## Business Model

14. **Pricing & Commission** ✅ USER CONFIRMED
    - This is a SAAS platform for store owners to use
    - Store owners manage their own pricing
    - **NO commission/fees charged by EcoPro** ✅ CONFIRMED - Store owners keep 100% of order revenue
    - Platform only charges $7/month subscription fee

## Platform Configuration

15. **Platform Settings - Admin Configurables** ✅ USER CONFIRMED
    - **Max Users**: ✅ YES - Enforce limit, reject new signups if reached
      - Default: 1,000 users
    - **Max Stores**: ✅ YES - Enforce limit, reject new store creation if reached
      - Default: 1,000 stores
    - **Commission Rate**: ❌ NOT USED - Remove from platform, no commission model
    - Settings are configurable by admin and apply platform-wide
    - Admin can change these limits anytime in Settings tab
    - TODO: Add validation to auth endpoints to check limits before allowing signup

## Discovery

16. **Search & Discovery**
    - NO marketplace view
    - Customers access stores directly via unique store link (e.g., /store/store-8hbhov9w)
    - Store owner shares their link however they want (social media, email, etc)

### Add new colors to the theme

Open `client/global.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` and add new tailwind colors.

### New API Route
1. **Optional**: Create a shared interface in `shared/api.ts`:
```typescript
export interface MyRouteResponse {
  message: string;
  // Add other response properties here
}
```

2. Create a new route handler in `server/routes/my-route.ts`:
```typescript
import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api"; // Optional: for type safety

export const handleMyRoute: RequestHandler = (req, res) => {
  const response: MyRouteResponse = {
    message: 'Hello from my endpoint!'
  };
  res.json(response);
};
```

3. Register the route in `server/index.ts`:
```typescript
import { handleMyRoute } from "./routes/my-route";

// Add to the createServer function:
app.get("/api/my-endpoint", handleMyRoute);
```

4. Use in React components with type safety:
```typescript
import { MyRouteResponse } from '@shared/api'; // Optional: for type safety

const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
const data: MyRouteResponse = await response.json();
```

### New Page Route
1. Create component in `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `client/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

## Production Deployment

- **Standard**: `pnpm build`
- **Binary**: Self-contained executables (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Cloud Deployment**: Use either Netlify or Vercel via their MCP integrations for easy deployment. Both providers work well with this starter template.

## Architecture Notes

- Single-port development with Vite + Express integration
- TypeScript throughout (client, server, shared)
- Full hot reload for rapid development
- Production-ready with multiple deployment options
- Comprehensive UI component library included
- Type-safe API communication via shared interfaces

- Store owner can view activity log in dashboard
- Critical actions flagged: delete product, delete order, change settings, remove staff

**Q31D: Permission Changes**
- ✅ **Instant Apply - Real-Time Updates**
- Owner toggles permission → applies immediately (no "Save" button)
- Manager loses access instantly if permission revoked
- Active sessions: manager is logged out if critical permissions revoked
- Manager can see their own permission status in dashboard

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Database Changes**
- Create `store_staff` table:
  - id, store_id, user_id, email, role (manager/staff), status (pending/active/inactive)
  - permissions JSON (map of permission_name: boolean)
  - created_at, invited_at, last_login, created_by (owner's user_id)
- Create `staff_activity_log` table:
  - id, store_id, staff_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, before_value, after_value, timestamp

### **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/seller/staff/invite` - Create manager account with permissions
- `GET /api/seller/staff` - List all staff with their permissions
- `PATCH /api/seller/staff/:id/permissions` - Toggle individual permission (instant apply)
- `PATCH /api/seller/staff/:id/status` - Activate/deactivate/remove staff
- `GET /api/seller/staff/:id/activity` - View staff's activity log
- `DELETE /api/seller/staff/:id` - Remove staff

### **Frontend Components**
- New page: **Staff Management** in settings
  - Tab 1: List all staff (name, email, status, last login, actions)
  - Tab 2: Invite new staff (email form)
  - Permission editor modal (opens when clicking staff name):
    - Grouped permission toggles (by category: Orders, Products, Analytics, etc)
    - Live toggle with instant save
    - Danger zone: Remove staff button
- Add activity log viewer in Staff Management

   - View Analytics & Reports
   - Export Data (CSV, PDF)
   - Manage Bot Settings (WhatsApp/SMS)
   - Manage Broadcasting
   - Invite/Manage Staff
   - View Activity Logs

### **Security Notes**
- Staff cannot change their own permissions
- Staff cannot invite other staff (owner only)
- Staff cannot view other staff's permissions (only owner)
- Staff cannot view financial/billing info (phase 2)
- Staff cannot see store owner's personal email/phone
- Activity log immutable (cannot be deleted by staff)
- Revoked permission = instant logout of manager's active sessions

### **UI/UX Details**
- Permission toggles grouped by category (not all in one long list)
- Search/filter staff by name or email
- Sort by: last login, created date, status
- Confirmation dialog when removing staff: "Are you sure? They will lose access immediately"
- Toast notification when permission changed: "Permission updated for [name]"
- Staff can see THEIR OWN permissions in their dashboard (read-only view)

### **TODO**

## 🛡️ SECURITY SYSTEM - Kernel & Honeypots

### Kernel Page (`/kernel`) - Root Access Only

The Kernel page is a **super-admin security dashboard** that only platform owners can access. It's separate from the regular admin panel.

**Access:**
- URL: `/kernel`
- Credentials: Set via environment variables `KERNEL_USERNAME` and `KERNEL_PASSWORD`
- Role: `root` (not `admin`) - completely separate auth system
- Table: `kernel_users` (separate from `users` table)

**Features:**
1. **System Status** - Server health, database connection, Render deployment info
2. **Security Events** - All auth failures, blocked IPs, suspicious activity
3. **Live Traffic Monitor** - Real-time HTTP requests with fingerprinting
4. **IP Management** - Block/unblock IPs, view blocked list
5. **Fingerprint Tracking** - Track attackers across different IPs
6. **Geo Blocking** - See blocks by country
7. **Hacker Account Flagging** - Auto-locked accounts from honeypots

**Key Files:**
- `server/routes/kernel.ts` - Kernel API endpoints
- `client/pages/Kernel.tsx` - Kernel dashboard UI
- `server/utils/security.ts` - Security utilities (fingerprinting, geo, logging)

### Honeypot System (Traps)

Hidden trap endpoints that catch hackers/bots scanning for vulnerabilities.

**How It Works:**
1. Trap routes look like common attack targets (`.env`, `wp-admin`, `phpMyAdmin`, etc.)
2. When accessed, the system:
   - **Auto-blocks the IP** permanently
   - **Flags the user account** if logged in (locks account)
   - **Logs detailed security event** with fingerprint
   - Returns fake "interesting" responses to waste attacker time

**Trap Categories:**
- **Environment Files**: `/.env`, `/config.php`, `/wp-config.php`
- **Admin Panels**: `/wp-admin`, `/phpmyadmin`, `/adminer`
- **API Exploits**: `/api/debug`, `/graphql`, `/.git/config`
- **Backup Files**: `/backup.sql`, `/db.sql`, `/dump.sql`

**Key Files:**
- `server/routes/traps.ts` - Honeypot trap routes
- Auto-blocks stored in `security_ip_blocks` table
- Events logged in `security_events` table

**Security Tables:**
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `kernel_users` | Root/kernel user accounts |
| `security_events` | All security events log |

## 🆕 RECENT CHANGES (December 26, 2025)

### Arabic to English Conversion - COMPLETE ✅

**ALL hardcoded Arabic text has been converted to English** throughout the platform. This was done to standardize the UI until a proper translation system is implemented.

#### What Was Converted:

**Client Pages (All Arabic → English):**
- `client/pages/admin/Orders.tsx` - Filter tabs, stats labels, sample customer names
- `client/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx` - Greetings, period selectors, stat labels
- `client/pages/admin/EnhancedDashboard.tsx` - Stats, subscription info, setup checklist, countdown labels
- `client/pages/admin/WasselniSettings.tsx` - All bot message templates
- `client/pages/admin/Calls.tsx` - Call management labels
- `client/pages/admin/orders/WasselniOrders.tsx` - Delivery tracking labels, sample data
- `client/pages/admin/orders/AbandonedOrders.tsx` - Stats labels, sample data
- `client/pages/admin/orders/AddOrder.tsx` - Form labels
- `client/pages/admin/orders/FlexScan.tsx` - Analytics insights
- `client/pages/admin/delivery/DeliveryCompanies.tsx` - API field placeholders
- `client/pages/customer/Dashboard.tsx` - Navigation labels
- `client/pages/customer/Login.tsx` - Form labels
- `client/pages/customer/Signup.tsx` - Form labels
- `client/pages/storefront/ProductCheckout.tsx` - Checkout form
- `client/pages/storefront/OrderConfirmation.tsx` - Confirmation page title
- `client/pages/Pricing.tsx` - Currency symbol (دج → DZD)

**Client Components:**
- `client/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Platform subtitle, aria labels
- `client/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Navigation links

**Server Routes (All Arabic → English):**
- `server/routes/orders.ts` - Status names (قيد الانتظار → Pending, etc.)
- `server/routes/telegram.ts` - All Telegram bot messages, callback button text
- `server/routes/bot.ts` - Default message templates
- `server/routes/public-store.ts` - Order notification templates
- `server/routes/dashboard.ts` - City labels

**Server Utils:**
- `server/utils/bot-messaging.ts` - WhatsApp template
- `server/utils/scheduled-messages.ts` - Confirm/Cancel button labels

#### What Remains Arabic (Intentionally):
- `client/lib/translations.ts` - Translation system file
- `client/lib/translations/ar.ts` - Arabic translation file
- Language switcher label "العربية" - The word for "Arabic" in Arabic

#### Currency:
- All instances of "دج" converted to "DZD" (Algerian Dinar)

#### Bot Message Templates (Now English):
```
Greeting: "Thank you for ordering from {storeName}, {customerName}!"
Instant Order: "🎉 Thank you, {customerName}! Your order has been received..."
Pin Instructions: "📌 Important tip: Long press on the previous message..."
Order Confirmation: "Hello {customerName}! Do you confirm the order?"
Payment: "Your order #{orderId} has been confirmed. Please pay {totalPrice} DZD."
Shipping: "Your order #{orderId} has been shipped. Tracking number: {trackingNumber}."
```

#### Telegram Callback Buttons:
- "✅ تأكيد الطلب" → "✅ Confirm Order"
- "❌ إلغاء الطلب" → "❌ Cancel Order"

#### How to Check for Remaining Arabic:
```bash
# Check client files (excluding translations)
grep -r -P '[\x{0600}-\x{06FF}]' client/pages/ client/components/ | grep -v translations

# Check server files
grep -r -P '[\x{0600}-\x{06FF}]' server/
```
